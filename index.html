			<p> I'm a street walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm
				I'm a runaway son of the nuclear A-bomb
				I am a world's forgotten boy
				Honey gotta help me please
				Somebody gotta save my soul
				The one who searches and destroys
				Baby detonate for me
				Look out honey, 'cause I'm using technology
				Ain't got time to make no apology
				Soul radiation in the dead of night
				Love in the middle of a fire fight
				Honey gotta strike me blind
				Somebody gotta save my soul
				Baby penetrate my mind
				And I'm the world's forgotten boy
				The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy
				And honey I'm the world's forgotten boy
				The one who's searchin', searchin' to destroy
				Forgotten boy, forgotten boy
				Forgotten boy said hey forgotten boy </p>

				<p>That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln town car, ain't it?
				Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it
				Now I'm drivin' 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleedin'
				And every time the cops pull me over, they don't ever see them
				And I've got this black suit on
				Roamin' around like I'm ready for a funeral
				Five more miles 'til the road runs out
				I'm about to drive in the ocean
				I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
				Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good
				Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good
				Got some pretty good beats on this 808 CD, yeah
				Memory seats I'm sittin' on stay heated
				I woulda put tints on my windows but what's the difference?
				If I feel like a Ghost, no Swayze
				Ever since I lost my baby
				I've had this black suit on
				Roamin' around like I'm ready for a funeral
				One more mile 'til the road runs out
				I'm about to drive in the ocean
				I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
				Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good
				Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good
				I'm goin' off (Oh, my pretty love)
				Don't try stopping me
				I'm goin' off (Throw me a line)
				Don't try saving (Broke my heart)
				No flares (Broke my heart)
				No vest (Drove my love)
				And no fear
				Waves are washin' me out
				I'm about to drive in the ocean
				I'ma try to swim from somethin' bigger than me
				Kick off my shoes and swim good, and swim good
				Take off this suit and swim good, and swim good, good</p>
